            <h5 id="ref2">Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design technique that lets web pages work effective on a
                range of devices
                and window or screen sizes. Content, design and efficiency across all platforms are important to ensure
                accessibility and satisfaction.</h5>

            <h4 id="ref1">What techniques, technologies, and patterns did you use in your Responsive design?</h4>
            <h5 id="ref2">My web pages layout is three coloums with main content in the middle. I designed in a
                way that all text and layout will enlarge or shrink according to the screen size of the device. </h5>
            <h4 id="ref1">What did you learn about building web apps for different devices?</h4>
            <h5 id="ref2">When building a web page, we have to think about the layouts for different devices for
                user-friendliness.</h5>

                The WEB222 final assessment is usually an exam, and covers everything in the course.
                However, due to the circumstances this term, we are NOT going to have an exam.
                Instead, we will be using an alternate final assessment. In terms of grading, this work will be
                equivalent to the exam, but can be done remotely and submitted online

                Design a storefront (you may work on part B of assignment 5
                i.e. storefront.html if you wish) so that you can have this webpage rendered to a mobile
                phone (hint: in lecture 9, several design was discussed). The storefront should have info
                of at least 10 similar products with related information such as title, description, price,
                image, etc. Only one html page and one css file is required.
